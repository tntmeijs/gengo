# GenGo
Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to the GenGo project. This project acts as my playground to learn the Go programming language.
The ultimate goal of this project is to render very nice artistic images using fractals or SDFs.

Having said that, though, please do not expect this project to be actively maintained in any way.
I just want to have some fun while learning Go - this project is not meant to be production-ready.

Anyway, hope you enjoy browsing this repository.

Cheers,

Tahar
